# Way to a Quant
Recording my path to a competent quant. 

Date: Jan. 6th, 2020
I have been struggling with programming since I was admitted to a MFE program. Since I am to receive a bachelor degree in accounting, alright... it's a huge leap for me.
At this moment, I am trying to learn to realise some Data Structures using C++, features of python and if possible, econometrics using R.
It seems unreasonable. But before this September, I would try to attain these.
